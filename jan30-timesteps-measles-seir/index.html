# Goals for today

1. Go over the measles handout

--

    - Sort of. Not going to answer the questions for you. Just going to help you go through the code to answer them on your own.

# Question 1
## Make an SIR model for measles

---
## Question 1

- Measles epidemic: 
    - Population: 1 million
    - Probability of infection is `\(.75\)` if in contact with an infectious person
    - 12 respiratory contacts **per week**
    - Disease duration of 1 week
    - For now, use SIR framework

---

```r
library(deSolve)

parms &lt;- c(beta = 0.333, k = 3 , r = 0.333)
inits &lt;- c(S = 499, I = 1, R = 0)
dt &lt;- seq(0, 300, 1)

SIR &lt;- function(t, x, parms){
    with(as.list(c(parms, x)), {
    
        N &lt;- S + I + R
        dS &lt;- - (beta * k * S * I) / N
        dI &lt;- + (beta * k * S * I) / N - r * I
        dR &lt;- r * I

        der &lt;- c(dS, dI, dR)
    
        return(list(der))
    }) 
}

                                func = SIR, parms = parms))
```
Start with the boilerplate code we gave you last week.

Make sure your time scale makes sense given your parameters.

- 300 weeks seems too long, so we change it to 10 weeks.
- 1 week at a time is too coarse, so we change it to days (`\(\frac{1}{7}\)`)

    - But **any** small number would work

- Since our `parms` are in units of weeks, we divide by `\(7\)` to make them days

- We change our time-steps to be 70 units of 1 day to match our previous simulation
--

- **NOTE:** We save the simulations in different variable

--

- How will the plot change?

The plot does not change.

We can verify this by looking directly at the data.

- Just make a new set of `parms` for each disease

--

- Change the parameter as appropriate

--

- Run the new simulations and save the results in new variables

--

- `dt` didn't change, our model (`SIR()`) didn't change, and `inits` didn't change.

# How to find the time of max infections
## Also, how to use max()
---
# When was the peak of infections?
We could just eyeball it, but instead, let's find the value of our `time` column when the peak of the **measles** epidemic occurred.
--

```r
simulation$time[which.max(simulation$I)]
```

```
## [1] 2
```
--

So the epidemic occurred at exactly two weeks — aggreeing with our plot.

---

# Ok, what's happening?

```r
simulation$time[which.max(simulation$I)]
```
- `which.max()` is a function that returns the index (location) of the maximum value in a vector

--

- `$` is shorthand for specifying a single column

--

- `[ ]` is shorthand for selecting a specific subset

--

- So we are saying "find the row index that corresponds to the highest value of `simulation$I`"

--

- Now take that row index and return the corresponding value of `simulation$time`

---
# Let's verify
Find the maximum value of `simulation$I`:
--

```r
max(simulation$I)
```

```
## [1] 644530
```
--
Which index is this max value? (`TRUE` means we hit the max, `FALSE` otherwise)

```r
max(simulation$I) == simulation$I
```

```
##  [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE
## [12] FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE
## [23] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE
## [34] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE
## [45] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE
## [56] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE
## [67] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE
```
Note here that the only `TRUE` is in the 15th position.
---
# Let's verify
So we could just ask for the 15th row of `simulation$time`:
--

```r
simulation$time[15]     ## equiv: simulation[15, 'time']
```

```
## [1] 2
```
--
Or we could just pass the entire boolean vector:

```r
simulation$time[max(simulation$I) == simulation$I]
```

```
## [1] 2
```
--
Or better yet, just stick to `which.max()`
---
# Aside: Boolean vectors

Just a vector of `TRUE` or `FALSE` (or `NA`) for whatever condition you specify.

--

Always equal to the length of the vector being compared.

--

What does this return? (Recall what `seq()` does from our last lab)

```r
seq(-5, 5, 1) &gt;= 0
```
--

- How long will the return vector be?
- How many `FALSE`? 
- How many `TRUE`?
--

```r
print(seq(-5, 5, 1) &gt;= 0)
```

```
##  [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE

# For-loop basics
Suppose you want to sweep through many values of a parameter.

--

You could just do this:

```r
parms_bd1 &lt;- c(beta = .75, a = 1/12 * 7, k = 12 , r = 1, 
              b = .020/52, d = .020/52)
parms_bd1 &lt;- c(beta = .75, a = 1/12 * 7, k = 12 , r = 1, 
              b = .025/52, d = .025/52)
parms_bd1 &lt;- c(beta = .75, a = 1/12 * 7, k = 12 , r = 1, 
              b = .030/52, d = .030/52)
parms_bd1 &lt;- c(beta = .75, a = 1/12 * 7, k = 12 , r = 1, 
              b = .035/52, d = .035/52)
```
--


But that's error-prone, tedious, and ugly. 

--

So we're going to use a loop.

```r
*for (placeholder_variable in list_of_values) {
    ## Do something -- hopefully more useful than printing

- `for()` declares you are going to make a loop in the `{`brackets`}`

```
- `for()` declares you are going to make a loop in the `{`brackets`}`
- To use `for()` we need to give it something to loop through — `list_of_values`

# For-loop basics
## The anatomy of a for loop

```r
sentence &lt;- c("The", "magic", "of", "for", "loops")
for (word in sentence) {
    ## Do something -- hopefully more useful than printing
    print(word)
}
```

```
## [1] "The"
## [1] "magic"
## [1] "of"
## [1] "for"
## [1] "loops"
```
--
So the first time this loop ran, `word` had the value of "The"

--

The second time, `word` had the value of "magic" and so on.

---
# For-loop basics
## Sidenote, you can also loop by index

```r
sentence &lt;- c("The", "magic", "of", "for", "loops")
for (idx in 1:5) {
    ## Do something -- hopefully more useful than printing
    print(sentence[idx])
}
```

```
## [1] "The"
## [1] "magic"
## [1] "of"
## [1] "for"
## [1] "loops"
```

Very common because it is more general

Useful when you only care about the position of an element (and not the element itself).

- `multiplier` is just a sequence `1, 2, 3, 4, 5`

- Variables inside the `{`brackets`}` of the `for` loop get overwritten with every loop, so we create an empty (`NULL`) variable **outside** of the `for` loop to store results.
