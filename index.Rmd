## Table of Contents (reverse chronological)
- [**Common Error Messages**](./errors.html)

- Week 1 (January 22, 2018)
    - [Introduction to `R`, discrete time models, non-infectious ODE models.](./20180124_intro_to_R_headaches/index.html) 
    - Download [`headache_exercises.zip`](./exercises/01_headaches/headache_exercises.zip)
        - Or download the code here (not recommended):
            - [`discrete_births_and_deaths.R`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mkiang/epi501_review/master/exercises/01_headaches/discrete_births_and_deaths.R)
            - [`headache_discrete.R`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mkiang/epi501_review/master/exercises/01_headaches/headache_discrete.R)
            - [`headache_ode.R`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mkiang/epi501_review/master/exercises/01_headaches/headache_ode.R)
    - Annotated code [Coming soon]

- Week 0 (January 16, 2018) 
    - [Software Carpentry](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/): Strongly recommend you do sections 0 to 3 if you've never used `R` before. This will get you up and running with the software and introduce you to RStudio.
    - [Swirl Tutorial](http://swirlstats.com/students.html): If you've never used `R` before, we highly recommend doing this tutorial and the SW tutorial (above).
    - [Super quick `R` Review](./spring_2017/jan25-intro-to-r/index.html): If you've used `R` in the past but need a refresher, this is a tutorial I made for Spring 2017. It is not nearly as thorough as the above two.
    - [Shiny app for ODE models](https://mkiang.shinyapps.io/DiseaseDynamics/): Example of what we'll be doing throughout the course.
