- Week 0 (January 16, 2018) 
    - [Software Carpentry](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/): Strongly recommend you do sections 0 to 3 if you've never used `R` before. This will get you up and running with the software and introduce you to RStudio.
    - [Swirl Tutorial](http://swirlstats.com/students.html): If you've never used `R` before, we highly recommend doing this tutorial and the SW tutorial (above).
    - [Shiny app for ODE models](https://mkiang.shinyapps.io/DiseaseDynamics/): Example of what we'll be doing throughout the course.
